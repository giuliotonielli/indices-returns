The crucial question many investors ask themselves is whether the stock market really returns an average of 7/8% per year. The scope of this short article is to try to provide an answer to that question. Of course, the answer won't be a precise percentage, as stock market returns may depend on the time period and index composition (tech stocks vs value stocks, developed countries stocks vs emerging countries stocks etc.).

A frequency distribution graph of 3 different indices will be provided, so that the reader can understand what returns to expect from the market. My initial idea was to provide a comparison with their correspondant ETFs as well. However, the main problem I encountered was the fact that most ETFs are relatively new. The only ETF that has a track record long enough is $SPY, which was created in 1993. ETFs tracking countries outside of the US are, at most, 15 years old (not enough data in my opinion). 

The only three differences in returns that we can expect between an index and an ETF are:
- dividends being reinvested if the ETF decides to follow an accumulation strategy
- a tracking error
- the Total Expense Ratio of the ETF 

I will analyze three indices and one of their correspondant ETFs:
- S&P500 index - $SPY etf for the US market
- Nikkei 225 (Japan)
- Ftse 100 (United Kingdom)

I chose those indices for the following reasons:
- Medium to long history
- Inflation data available (most developing countries, such as China, have a relatively short inflation track record, and they may even fake some of the data :0)

And now, let's get started!")
